# Installation Guide

# Prerequisites
- Python (>=3.8)
- PostgreSQL
- Virtual Environment (recommended)

# Setup Instructions
1. Download files from Zip folder and add it to your folder

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   python -m venv venv
   On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Set up the database:
   - Create a PostgreSQL database
   - Update `config.py` with your database and Mail credentials 
   - Run database migrations:
     flask db init
     flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
     flask db upgrade

5. Run the application:

   flask run
   The app will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

# Configuration
Update the `config.py` file with your PostgreSQL and email SMTP settings:

class Config:
    SECRET_KEY = 'your_secret_key'
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'postgresql://username:password@localhost/examdb'
    MAIL_SERVER = 'smtp.yourmail.com'
    MAIL_PORT = 587
    MAIL_USE_TLS = True
    MAIL_USERNAME = 'your-email@example.com'
    MAIL_PASSWORD = 'your-email-password'
